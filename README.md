# Common Random Numbers for Stochastic Network-Based Transmission Dynamic Models

### We demonstrate a method to use common-random numbers in stochastic network-based transmission dynamic models. The code embeds a susceptible-infected transmission model on a static network. The method can be applied to more complicated transmission models as well as dynamic networks.
